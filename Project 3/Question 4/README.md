Here we were asked to develop a computer program with both a graphical and GUI part. Below is a screen shot of the GUI that prompts the user for the parameters of a and b as well as the color for the plot.

Clicking on the "Sin Plot" button will open a new window with the sin graph of the cardioid, which is shown below. Since the input for the color sin and cos with new parameters.pngwas "g" the plot will be green.

Here, we can see the how the color changes correspondingly to the inputted value.

Clicking on the "Cos Plot" button will repeat the previous step using a cos graph. Because the color attribute was changed from "g" to "r" effectively changing the color of the plot to red.

Here we have both plots on the same graph together.

Changing the value of the b parameter.
