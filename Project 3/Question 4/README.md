Here we were asked to develop a computer program with both a graphical and GUI part. Below is a screen shot of the GUI that prompts the user for the parameters of a and b.

Clicking on the "Sin Plot" button will open a new window with the sin graph of the cardioid, which is shown below.

Clicking on the "Cos Plot" button will repeat the previous step using a cos graph.

Changing the value of the b parameter.
