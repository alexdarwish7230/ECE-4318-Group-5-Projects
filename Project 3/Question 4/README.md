Below are screenshots of the website as the website itself hasn't been deployed yet. All the buttons and the hyperlinks are interactive.

Here we were asked to develop a computer program with both a graphical and GUI part. Below is a screen shot of the GUI that prompts the user for the parameters of a and b.
